Gravity as a Relativistic Effect
================================
Modern scientific cosmology is one of the most impressive intellectual  
achievements in the natural sciences.  
A scientific approach of information from observations performed over  
centuries, has led to a macroscopic description of the Universe based  
on the laws of classical mechanics, thermodynamics and electromagnetism.  
However, at the beginning of the twentieth century, the advent of the   
theories of relativity and quantum mechanics completely changed our  
view on the physical world.  
It was soon realised that Newton's classical description of gravity  
was not in agreement with the principles of relativity.  

Starting from the relativity postulates and basic principles, Einstein  
derived his general theory of relativity which comprises a modern  
description of gravity.  
This new viewpoint allows for a scientific approach to describe the Universe  
and its evolution by the behaviour of matter and light under the influence  
of gravity. As such, this theory forms the basis of the current Standard  
Model of cosmology and is employed in the interpretation of all observations.  

A proper treatment of the general theory of relativity can only be achieved  
by invoking a formal discussion based on tensor calculus.  
However, to make the subject also available to students at the bachelor level  
and at university colleges, a different approach has been used in this course.  
By making use of symmetrical situations and sometimes taking the freedom of  
using handwaving arguments instead of mathematical rigor, the basic aspects  
of general relativity and gravitation are addressed without getting lost in  
mathematical details.  
The obtained expressions are exact and may be used to study the behaviour  
of matter and radiation in the vicinity of isolated massive objects like  
planets, (neutron) stars and black holes.
